# Generated Data

This folder stores **large generated data files** required by the project.

> ⚠️ **Important:** These files can be **several gigabytes in size** and are therefore **not included in version control**.

## Purpose

- Intermediate or final outputs from data processing pipelines.
- Large datasets generated from raw data, simulations, or model outputs.
- Used during runtime or for analysis, but **not meant to be edited manually**.

## Setup

These files must be **generated locally** by running the appropriate setup or data processing scripts. Ensure your installation or build process includes this step.

## Version Control

These files are usually jsonl files.
